#Contributing Guidelines

First off...

![BillMurraySays](media/BillYoureAwesome.jpg)

There are many areas you can help contribute to this project and below are just a few examples.

- Schematic design - The goal is to keep these gates cheap and easy, so we're game for anything that goes towards that goal.
- Hardware optimization - Do you see a way to accelerate the build process? Add it!
- Firmware Additions - Making the animations faster, using DMA or the like, would be great!
- Firmware Optimization - Breaking this project down into smaller files would be awesome. I have that on my list, but no time to do it.
- New and Innovative Patterns - Let your imagination run wild.
- Documentation - How to videos, better hardware docs.

##Checkout the code

Clone this repo and get familiar with the design, the build, and the firmware. 
Take note of the general coding practices and try to keep them in mind when adding to the mix.

##Testing

Since this is a small project, testing with the general hardware is a must before checking in code. Just a Nano board and a dense set of LEDs work great for a test platform.

##Committing

Once you are ready create a branch in one of the following categories.
- feature/&lt;branchname&gt; - for new features.
- bug/&lt;branchname&gt; - for bug fixes.

##Pull Request

When you are ready to merge your code into master create a pull request for review. Please allow some time for others to test and approve your PR.
