This project is an extension of the original code I created for the BBT Tiny Whoop Race Gates. 
I've expanded and simpified the code and schematics for use with a new open-source project.

These gates were (at one time) manufactured under my company, [Bright Blue Tech](https://www.facebook.com/BrightBlueDroneTech/)
